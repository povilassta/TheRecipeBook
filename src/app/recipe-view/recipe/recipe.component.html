    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li (click)="toggleClass($event, 'completed')">
        Dice the onion and add it to an oven safe deep skillet (3 qt. capacity)
        along with the butter. Sauté over medium heat until the onions are soft
        and translucent.
      </li>
      <li (click)="toggleClass($event, 'completed')">
        While the onions are cooking, dice the chicken breast into small,
        1/2-inch pieces. Add the chicken to the skillet and continue to sauté
        for about 3 minutes more, or just until the outside of the chicken
        pieces have turned opaque (the chicken will finish cooking through as it
        simmers with the rice).
      </li>
      <li (click)="toggleClass($event, 'completed')">
        Add the rice, thyme, sage, salt, some freshly cracked pepper (about ten
        cranks of a pepper mill), and the chicken broth to the skillet and stir
        to combine.
      </li>
      <li (click)="toggleClass($event, 'completed')">
        Place a lid on the skillet, turn the heat up to medium-high, and allow
        the broth to come to a boil. Once it reaches a full boil, turn the heat
        down to low and let the skillet simmer for 15 minutes, stirring
        occasionally, replacing the lid each time. Cooking the rice in an excess
        of broth and stirring occasionally as it cooks will produce a saucy rice
        mixture.
      </li>
      <li (click)="toggleClass($event, 'completed')">
        After 15 minutes, the rice should be tender and saucy (if not yet
        tender, let it continue to cook for 5 more minutes). Stir in the frozen
        vegetables (no need to thaw), replace the lid, and let it sit over
        medium-low heat for another 5 minutes to heat the vegetables through.
        Finally, add the heavy cream, stir to combine, taste, and add extra salt
        if needed (this will depend on the salt content of the broth you used).
      </li>
      <li (click)="toggleClass($event, 'completed')">
        Turn on the oven's broiler, top the skillet with the shredded cheese,
        and place the skillet in the oven under the broiler for a few minutes to
        melt the cheese. Serve hot.
